# Car-Dashboard-Simulator
COURSE PROJECT: An input file containing the distance travelled, rpm and fuel tank level of a commuter vehicle over a 10-minute period was provided to us. Using this data I converted the input values into speed, logged fuel economy, range and displayed them in real time on a simulated on-screen car gauge.
